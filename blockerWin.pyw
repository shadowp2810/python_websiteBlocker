# To automate the task and have it run at starup:
# Go to Task Scheduler on Windows, 
# Create a new task, name it, eg: "Website blocker", check "Run with highest previleges", 
# go to "Triggers" tab in same task window and say Begin the task: "At Startup"
# go to "Actions" tab in same task window, click "New..", 
# select from dropdown "Start a program", and click Browse to locate the pyw file "blockerWin.pyw" #pyw files can execute without manually running on cmd
# go to "Conditions" tab and uncheck "Start the task only if computer is on AC power"

# python loop runs every 5 second and checks if it should block sites or not by the time and modifies host file.
